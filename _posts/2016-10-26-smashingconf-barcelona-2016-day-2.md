First day was a blast. Learned a ton of stuff I had know idea I didn't know and that I'm able to use in production now. I'm surprised to say that the second day has been even better. Again, just a disclaimer that these notes weren't edited and they were added just as they were jotted down. Enjoy!

<ul>
	<li>Predictions “Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons”</li>
	<li>Humans are bad a predicting exponential growth</li>
	<li>‘How did you go bankrupt?’ Bill asked. ‘Two ways,’ Mike said. ‘Gradually and then suddenly’ - Hemingway, the Sun Also Rises</li>
	<li>Find the things that change exponentially, they are the things that really impact the world.</li>
	<li>Moore’s law - The complexity for minimum component costs increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Carnally over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase.</li>
	<li>The best way to predict the future is to invent it - Alan Kay</li>
	<li>Prediction - “I think the browser is going to disappear” “Platforms are going to go away; computing will be everywhere because hardware will get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper” “The screen will disappear”</li>
	<li>Native apps are a remnant of the jurassic period of computer history, a local maximum that is holding us back..</li>
	<li>What is the one weird old trick about exponential growth? We need to act on our research & predictions. Carp Diem. Make good predictions, work on meaningful things and help invent that future.</li>

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>

<b>Q:</b> We’re so obsessed with Browsers as community, but there isn’t a business there?
<br><b>A:</b>The browsers are a way we can influence the web. Whichever platform donates will shape the web in their interest, even if those interests are very benign. 

<h3>My Takeaway</h3>

Predicting the future is what John’s good at. He predicted responsive design about 10 years before Ethan discovered/coined it. His take on predicting the future is interesting: don’t just predict, take action on those predictions. I jotted down a few of his future predictions which will be interesting to come back to in 10 years to see what he got right.
