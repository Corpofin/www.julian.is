      <description>Over the past 2 years I’ve dedicated part of my career to building a conversion rate optimization (CRO) team from the ground up. During this time, we ran over 300 tests on over 20 different client &amp;amp; internal websites with traffic ranging from 1,000 to 1.5 million sessions a month. We hit some home runs, made plenty of mistakes, and learned a TON along the way.
In hopes of saving you a few headaches, I&amp;rsquo;ve curated a list of some of the most important lessons learned.</description>
